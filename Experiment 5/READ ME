SCENARIO 1 – K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN)


Problem Statement

Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on medical measurements.


Dataset (Kaggle – Public)

Breast Cancer Dataset Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset


Target Variable: Diagnosis (Benign / Malignant)

Input Feature:

• Radius

• Texture

• Perimeter

• Area

• Smoothness


IN-LAB TASKS (KNN Classification)

1. Import required Python libraries.

2. Load the Breast Cancer dataset.

3. Perform data inspection & preprocessing.

4. Encode target labels.

5. Apply feature scaling (very important for KNN).

6. Split dataset into training and testing sets.

7. Train a KNN classifier.

8. Experiment with different values of K.

9. Predict diagnosis labels.

10. Evaluate performance using: • Accuracy • Precision / Recall / F1 Score

11. Identify misclassified cases.

12. Analyze model sensitivity to K.


Visualization

• Confusion Matrix

• Accuracy vs K Plot

• Decision Boundary (using two features)
